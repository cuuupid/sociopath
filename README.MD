# Hacking My Life

Here's a quick collection of things that I've made use of in my personal life, from social engineering to convenience utilities to entertainment scrapers to applications of big data. :kiss:

[ChanceyNN](https://github.com/pshah123/ChanceyNN) - predict college admissions easily using Artificial Neural Networks

[Gitsploit](https://github.com/pshah123/gitsploit) - give yourself thousands of commits, in the past, instantly

[FB-Hack](https://github.com/pshah123/fb-hack) - **Removed due to takedown notice.** Send payload through messenger and target desktop application Messenger. Relies on user dragging and dropping link, then steals the access token and injects into API v2.4 to steal images, read messages, and assume total control of the account (feed, status, friends, etc.)

[Node-Attack](https://github.com/pshah123/node-attack) - **Removed due to takedown notice.** Automatically create malicious packages, starting a server using `server.js` to retrieve data and posting data to the server from `keylogger.js`, publishes to NPM as a common name

[Manga-Ripper](https://github.com/pshah123/manga-ripper) - Scrape popular manga into images. **Coming soon: Ocropy and translation using [Attention+NMT](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt)**

[StudentRoom-Scraper](https://github.com/pshah123/studentroom_scraper) - Scrape studentroom, made because thread search didn't exist (and afaik still doesn't exist). Looks for a set of keywords.

[Star Me, Daddy!](https://github.com/pshah123/star-me-daddy) - started as a Github bot to automatically star, now includes traffic bots, follow bots, linkedin bots, curated list automaters, etc. **Removed due to takedown notice.**

[Youtube-To-MP3](https://github.com/pshah123/python-youtube-to-mp3) - scrape youtube video as MP3 extremely quickly

[Shillscript](https://github.com/pshah123/shillscript) - esoteric programming language processed in python and written as a jab to Hillary; neat features like "accidental" deletion of all code and easy to use private mailing server
